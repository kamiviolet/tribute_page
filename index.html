            <h2 id="about">About the page</h2>
            <p>Tribute page is one of the projects one would build when learning web development.. The first time when I read the instructions in freecodecamp about this project (it was in summer 2022), admittedly, I struggled and confused. I wondered which great thinker in history I should choose to be the topic... or perhaps my favourite film director? Yet, after few months and now I am building the same project with more skills equipped, I wish to choose another approach to the topic and I asked myself the question below:</p>
            <p>What is tribute?</p>
            <p>
                As I am not a native English speaker, I looked up to the dictionary and found the following, 
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Tribute means something given or contributed voluntarily... showing respect, gratitude, or affection</p>
                    <cite>From Merriam Webster</cite>
                    </blockquote>
                And suddenly it came to my mind that this can be used to record the achievements of a closed one and their (once) existence. Indeed, famous people have already many tribute pages dedicated to their achievements and influence, and each page contains more or less similar information, sometimes in greater details and sometimes rather in brief. On the other hand, ordinary people must also have something in their life worth being recorded in this vast internet, particularly those who have been special to us.
            </p>
            <p>As a result, this triute page is made by me for my sister, Kayan Lam.</p>

                <p>Kayan was a very energetic and adorable person with her own struggles and shadows.</p>
                <p>Once Kayan set goal on something, she was unstoppable and this characteristic of hers helped her achieve many miracles, in work and in private life, just like her Chinese zodiac sign, the boar.

                <p>Alerted by unnaturally frequent periods in a single month, Kayan decided to visit her doctor for cervical screening in March 2020, at age of 36.</p>
                <p>After then when she was about to resume her busy single-mother worklife, she was informed the test result was not normal and immediately referred to a further examination. She was diagnosed of cervical cancer, in stage 4 which means there had been widespread metastasis.</p>
                <p>On top of that, the type of her cancer was rare and unknown, not related to HIV, the major trigger for most of cervical cancers.</p>
                <p>Worried about the future of her 9 year old son, Kayan was determined to take part in any possible treatments. In May 2020, in the heat of COVID-19, she went through 2 months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in Ariake Cancer Hospital in Tokyo.</p>
                <h4>Death</h4>
                <p>Following the celebration for her son's 10-year-old birthday at home in Early December, Kayan was called back to hospital for a week of stay. During the time, she fell into deep coma due to the third stroke happened. She passed away a day before her own birthday, on 23 December 2020.</p>
