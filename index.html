            <h2 id="about">About the page</h2>
            <p>Tribute page is one of the projects always recommended for frontend learners to build up their skills for its "beginner-friendiness". Admittedly, in the beginning I was struggling which great thinker in history I should choose to be the topic... or perhaps my favourite film director?</p>
            <p>Yet, what is tribute?</p>
            <p>A tribute should be <q>something given voluntarily to show respect, gratitude, admiration, or affection</q>. It came to my mind suddenly that this can be used to record the achievements of a closed one and their (once) existence. Indeed, famous people have already many tribute pages dedicated to their achievements and influence, and each page contains more or less similar information, sometimes in greater details and sometimes rather in brief. On the other hand, ordinary people must have something in their life also worth being recorded in the internet, particularly those who have been special to us.</p>
            <p>As a result, this triute page is for my sister, Kayan Lam.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Family background</h3>
                <p>Kayan Lam was the eldest daughter of the family. Accordingly, before she was born, her mother gave birth to a baby boy who was immediately found dead due to the poor facilities of hospital and the staff there. By the time of moving to Japan for further study at the age of 19, she had been living with her parents and a younger sister, in a studio flat in a public house in Hong Kong.</p>

                <p>Kayan was a very energetic and adorable person with her own struggles and shadows.</p>
                <p>Once Kayan set goal on something, she was unstoppable and this characteristic of hers helped her achieve many miracles, in work and in private life, just like her Chinese zodiac sign, the boar. It might be also contributed by Kayan's parents holding high expectations about her academic performance when she was at school. </p>
                <p>Kayan cared about her friends so much that her kindness brought her lots of precious friendships.</p>

                <h4>Diagnosed of Cancer</h4>
                <p>Alerted by unnaturally frequent periods in a single month, Kayan decided to visit her doctor for cervical screening in March 2020, at age of 36.</p>
                <p>After then when she was about to resume her busy single-mother worklife, she was informed the test result was not normal and immediately referred to a further examination. She was diagnosed of cervical cancer, in stage 4 which means there had been widespread metastasis.</p>
                <p>On top of that, the type of her cancer was rare and unknown, not related to HIV, the major trigger for most of cervical cancers.</p>
                <p>Worried about the future of her 9 year old son, Kayan was determined to take part in any possible treatments. In May 2020, in the heat of COVID-19, she went through 2 months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in Ariake Cancer Hospital in Tokyo.</p>
                <h4>Death</h4>
                <p>Following the celebration for her son's 10-year-old birthday at home in Early December, Kayan was called back to hospital for a week of stay. During the time, she fell into deep coma due to the third stroke happened. She passed away a day before her own birthday, on 23 December 2020.</p>
