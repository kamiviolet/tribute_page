            <h2 id="about">About the page</h2>
            <p>Tribute page is one of the projects one would build when learning web development.. The first time when I read the instructions in freecodecamp about this project (it was in summer 2022), admittedly, I struggled and confused. I wondered which great thinker in history I should choose to be the topic... or perhaps my favourite film director? Yet, after few months and now I am building the same project with more skills equipped, I wish to choose another approach to the topic and I asked myself the question below:</p>
            <p>What is tribute?</p>
            <p>As I am not a native English speaker, I looked up to the dictionary and found the following, </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Tribute means something given or contributed voluntarily... showing respect, gratitude, or affection</p>
                    <cite>From Merriam Webster</cite>
                </blockquote>
            <p>And suddenly it came to my mind that this can be used to record the achievements of a closed one and their (once) existence. Indeed, famous people have already many tribute pages dedicated to their achievements and influence, and each page contains more or less similar information, sometimes in greater details and sometimes rather in brief. On the other hand, ordinary people must also have something in their life worth being recorded in this vast internet, particularly those who have been special to us.</p>
            <p>As a result, this triute page is made by me for my sister, Kayan Lam.</p>

            <h2 id="intro">Who is she?</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Family background</h3>
                <p>Kayan Lam was the eldest daughter of the family. Accordingly, before she was born, her mother gave birth to a baby boy who was immediately found dead due to the poor facilities of hospital and the staff there. By the time of moving to Japan for further study at the age of 19, she had been living with her parents and a younger sister, in a studio flat in a public house in Hong Kong.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Kayan was a very energetic and adorable person with her own struggles and shadows.</p>
                <p>Once Kayan set goal on something, she was unstoppable and this characteristic of hers helped her achieve many miracles, in work and in private life, just like her Chinese zodiac sign, the boar. It might be also contributed by Kayan's parents holding high expectations about her academic performance when she was at school. </p>
                <p>Kayan cared about her friends so much that her kindness brought her lots of precious friendships.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Birth</h3>
                <p>Kayan was born on 24 December 1983, an afternoon at Christmas. Until the puberty, she was suffering from asthma and some other health problems. Once at her birthday party, she got epilepsy that her parents had to carry her running to the A&E at night - luckily back then they were living very close to the hospital.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Death</h3>
                <h4>Diagnosed of Cancer</h4>
                <p>In March 2020, alerted by unnaturally frequent periods in a single month, Kayan decided to visit her doctor for cervical screening. Then as she was about to resume her busy  working life as a single-mother in a foreign country, she was informed the test result was not normal and immediately referred to a further examination. She was diagnosed of cervical cancer, in stage 4 which means there had been widespread metastasis.</p>
                <p>She was at her age of 36 at that moment.</p>
                <p>On top of that, the medical staff confessed that they were not certain about the type of her cancer but only knew it was rare and unrelated to HIV, the major trigger for most of cervical cancers.</p>
                <p>Worried about the future of her 9 year old son, Kayan was determined to take part in any possible treatments. In May 2020, in the heat of COVID-19, she went through 2 months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in Ariake Cancer Hospital in Tokyo.</p>
                <h4>Death</h4>
                <p>Kayan's situation got momentarily improved in summer but soon in less than a month, her metastasis turned worse and through the examination, the medical staff in Japan decided to stop providing her any active treatments.</p>
                <p>After consulting with many people and a discreet consideration, in September, Kayan left for Hong Kong with her son and her younger sister who went to Japan as a support in summer. Once she got back to Hong Kong, she was admitted to the department of oncology in Tuen Mun Hospital. The senior medical officer there raised their a collection of doubts when reading through the referral report from the hospital in Japan, admitted now Kayan's situation got worsened by the delay of a proper treatment but willing to help her at their best.</p>
                <p>Later Kayan had a severe stroke leading to the realisation that it was not her first time. She had a mild one in summer due to the thrombosis.</p>
                <p>Following the celebration for her son's 10-year-old birthday at home in Early December, Kayan was called back to hospital for a week of stay. During the time, she had the third stroke and fell into deep coma afterwards. She passed away a day before her 37th birthday, on 23 December 2020.</p>

            <p>Kayan was perseverant and multitalented that she was able to achieve her goal so long as she set her determination on it. However, there had been a top challenge in her life and that was her relationships.</p>

            <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
            <p>My intention was stated in the first section on this page - to record my sister's existence in the internet for her virtues and my complicated affection towards her.</p>
            <p>To start with, it has been not easy to decide which color tones may be suitable for presenting her. Yet, compared with the application of my web development skills, what is most challenging is the context.</p>
            <p>What should I put on the web for the public? What would it be inappropriate to be mentioned but worth being recorded because it was part of her pain?</p>
            <p>This may be just a small basic project but will be ongoing updated, with its content and presentation. Hopefully, by obtaining these skills, I got more to offer and have the strength to protect whom I care.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I wish to build something small it may be but has its own value.</p>
